Two points are displayed on a map, and you have to draw the shortest route between the two points. The route is then automatically marked to see if you got the shortest route.

Originially Created by Ben Brown for the [Lockdown Orienteering Sprint Weekend](http://lockdownorienteering.wordpress.com/) to test and practice routechoice.
